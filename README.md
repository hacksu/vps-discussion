# Virtual Private Servers
What are they? How do I get started? What they do? What to use? Time to take a deep dive into the amazing world of the internet!

Virtual Private Servers are the easiest way to host websites and programs on the internet!

You've probably heard of a "server" before, so what's "virtual" and "private" about this? Well, these servers are hosted in the cloud by hosting providers through the use of Virtual Machines. You don't have any physical hardware, thus the "virtual" part. Then, its "private" because your resources that are allocated to your Virtual Machine are yours; you don't share them with anyone else. There are other, cheaper forms of hosting out there that share your resources, leading to lessened reliability and the possibility of some other user hogging all your machine's resources because you both are using the same CPU.

For as little as $5 a month, you can own a Virtual Private Server from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/)!
