# Virtual Private Servers
What are they? How do I get started? What they do? What to use? Time to take a deep dive into the amazing world of the internet!

Virtual Private Servers are the easiest way to host websites and programs on the internet!

You've probably heard of a "server" before, so what's "virtual" and "private" about this? Well, these servers are hosted in the cloud by hosting providers through the use of Virtual Machines. You don't have any physical hardware, thus the "virtual" part. Then, its "private" because your resources that are allocated to your Virtual Machine are yours; you don't share them with anyone else. There are other, cheaper forms of hosting out there that share your resources, leading to lessened reliability and the possibility of some other user hogging all your machine's resources because you both are using the same CPU.

For as little as $5 a month, you can own a Virtual Private Server from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/)!

A VPS can do the same things as a normal server can; it's just virtualized and hosted in the cloud! You can host your website right inside a datacenter and get lightning fast speeds and reliability for an extremely low cost!

# Signing up for DigitalOcean
You can use my [Referral Code](https://m.do.co/c/100bab0e5e4e) to get started. You will get a $100 credit that lasts 60 days so you can play around with everything DigitalOcean has to offer! However, be sure to have your credit or debit card ready as you will be required to enter payment info so they can verify you are a real person (don't worry, you won't be charged unless you exceed your available credit).

# Creating a Virtual Private Server
You can head [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?distro=ubuntu-20-04-x64&size=s-1vcpu-1gb) to set up a new Ubuntu droplet, or you can open https://cloud.digitalocean.com, go to the top right, and click `CREATE`, then `Droplet`. My personal recommendation is to use Ubuntu 20.04 and the $5/month tier.

**WARNING**: The $40/month tier is selected by default! Don't end up with a $40 bill if you don't want to!

If you've got that $100 free-trial credit, you can do any server you want. 

If you want to YOLO your free-trial credits (**not recommended**), you can buy a General-Purpose Droplet with **160GB Memory**, **40 Virtual CPUs**, and a **500GB SSD**; __but only for 2 days and 7 hours__. Be sure to turn off that droplet after that or else you'll end up with a **$1200 bill at the end of the month**!!!
